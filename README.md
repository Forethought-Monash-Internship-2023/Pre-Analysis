This is repo with basic exploration of analysis, aligning processing and analytical methods before writing packages

# OpenAI Sentiment Analysis
This has been done using openAI via API Artificial intelligence engine, which needs paid and billable accounts of openAI keys within the openAI function in order to run the code. Since this process of using openAI API requires payment and billing, contributors of this repository would not be giving their own keys for public usage for free.
Thus, initial setting of codes below is required to run

Sys.setenv(
    OPENAI_API_KEY = 'xxxxx'
)

While 'xxxxx' being your own paid API key

Therefore, unless keys are valid, codes including completion using openAI might not be reproducible.
